## Counter Component

The Counter component has been implemented with the functionality to increment the count when a button is clicked. To maintain scoped styles and prevent style conflicts, CSS modules have been utilized for styling. The following files have been updated as part of this implementation:

- **Count.jsx**: This file contains the Counter component implementation. It utilizes the useState hook to manage the count state and defines a function to handle count incrementation upon button click.

- **Count.module.css**: This CSS module file contains styles specific to the Counter component. The `.btn` class defined here is applied to the button element in Count.jsx to ensure consistent styling within the component.

This approach ensures a modular and maintainable codebase, facilitating better organization and scalability of the project.
